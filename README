1) About:

parprouted is a daemon for transparent IP (Layer 3) proxy ARP bridging. 
Unlike standard bridging, proxy ARP bridging allows to bridge Ethernet 
networks behind wireless nodes. Normal L2 bridging does not work between 
wireless nodes because wireless does not know about MAC addresses used 
in the wired Ethernet networks.

The daemon will check ARP table every second and add direct /32 routes to your
kernel to the hosts learned via ARP. This way, your kernel will be able
to route the packets to the destination host when it receives it and you will
not have to care about setting routing/subnetting manually. All routes
entered by the daemon will have a metric of 50. 

2) Installation:

parprouted requires "ip" program form iproute2 tools to be installed in 
/sbin. If it is installed in another location, please replace "/sbin/ip" 
occurances in the source with the correct path.

In order for this daemon to work, you have to enable proxy ARP in your 
kernel. You can do it like this:

cat 1 > /proc/sys/net/conf/[interface]/proxy_arp

You have to do it for each interface you want to bridging on.

The daemon accept only one switch "-d", which stands for debugging. If you
run it in debugging mode the daemon will go to background and will print
additional debugging information to stdout/stderr.
