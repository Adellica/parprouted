parprouted 0.65:
Fix a problem with incorrect handling of a case when there are two entries 
for the same IP, incomplete and correct one. This can happen when machine 
running parprouted is rebooted. 
Credit for the fix goes to Dennis Borgmann <herakles@gmx.net> and 
Matthias Huning <mhuning@gmx.de>.

parprouted 0.50:
Much improved performance and robustness. Request queue is now kept
for all received ARP requests, ensuring that all new requests get answered
quickly (around 60 ms in my test).

parprouted 0.3:
Critical bugfix. Previous parprouted failed in networks of any 
considerable complexity. Almost complete rewrite. parprouted now is 
multithreaded and does  everything in userspace (including ARP relaying,
spoofing and listening). No need to set proxy_arp in kernel anymore.
